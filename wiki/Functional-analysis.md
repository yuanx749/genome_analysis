# Analysis of metabolic and other functional capabilities
I wrote a Python [script](/code/parse.py) to extract ID, genes and their functions from the annotations files, and classified the genes into several functional categories as in the paper. As expected, genes in different metabolic systems were identified.
- Energy conservation: ATP synthase, NADH dehydrogenase, etc.
- Carbon fixation: reductive TCA cycle
- Nitrogen fixation: nitrogenase complex
- Metal resistance: As/Cu/Ag/Cd/Co/Zn/Hg efflux pump
- Chemotaxis and motility: movement in response to a chemical stimulus, assembly of flagella, sensing environmental signals
- Oxidative stress response: reactive oxygen species (ROS) degradation, production of antioxidants
- Biofilm formation: cellulose production, polysaccharide synthesis and export

Results are written in these two tables for investigation as well as deeper analysis.
