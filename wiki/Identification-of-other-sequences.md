# Identification of repeats
The genome in fasta file was uploaded to [this website](http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/trf.submit.options.html) to find tandem repeats. 

Unlike eukaryote, there are not many tandem repreats in prokaryotic genome. Results can be viewed [here](http://tandem.bu.edu/trf/output/565VoNN5sV6oI.2.7.7.80.10.50.500.1.txt.html).
